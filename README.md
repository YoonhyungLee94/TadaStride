# TadaStride
* This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "TadaStride: Using Time Adaptive Strides in Audio Data for Effective Downsampling"
* It provides the complete source code needed to implement TadaStride, along with test code for conducting speech emotion recognition experiments using the IEMOCAP dataset.

## Prepare and preprocess the IEMOCAP dataset
* Ensure you have obtained the IEMOCAP dataset. Preprocess it using the `prepare_dataset.ipynb` notebook provided in this repository.
